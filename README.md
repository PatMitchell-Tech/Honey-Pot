For my emerging technolgies course I created a honey pot within my LAN and I used several kali linux based VM's to interact with it.

On my raspberry pi 4 I setup one RDP honeypot and one HTTP honeypot. Using open source tool pentbox I gathered ip addresses,
operating systems, and what type of device(such as desktop or phone)
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Most of this project was trial and error of setting up the honeypot and reconfiguring it for different ports.
